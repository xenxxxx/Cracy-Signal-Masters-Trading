# Crypto Signal

The goal of this project is to provide an API that recommends Buy/Sell/Hold of Bitcoin at any given time to maximize profitability.


## Features

#### This release
- [x] Price prediction is here! Adapted Stocker class to predict Bitcoin price. Please see Stocker Prediction Usage.ipynb notebook found in this repository.
- [x] Export flat files from sqlitedb to use in Tableau.

#### Next release
- [ ] Incorporate OHLCV (open, high, low, close,volume) trends with ML algorithm.

   # Signaler service

Every minute, the signaler performs the following steps to make a prediction about whether the price is likely to increase or decrease:
* Retrieve the latest data from the server and update the current data window which includes some history (the history length is defined by a configuration parameter)
* Compute derived features based on the nearest history collected (which now includes the latest data). The features to be computed are described in the configuration file and are exactly the same as used in batch mode during model training
* Apply several (previously trained) ML models by forecasting some future values (not necessarily prices) which are also treated as (more complex) derived features. We apply several forecasting models (currently, Gradient Boosting, Neural network, and Linear regression) to several target variables (labels)
* Aggregate the results of forecasting produced by different ML models and compute the final signal score which reflects the strength of the upward or downward trend. Here we use many previously computed scores as inputs and derive one output score. Currently, it is implemented as an aggregation procedure but it could be based on a dedicated ML model trained on previously collected scores and the target variable. Positive score means growth and negative score means fall
* Use the final score for notifications
  ![Never loose a gainer again](https://github.com/upggr/ielko-microtrader/blob/master/screenshots/gainers.png)

Notes:
* The final result of the signaler is the score (between -1 and +1). The score should be used for further decisions about buying or selling by taking into account other parameters and data sources
* For the signaler service to work, trained models have to be available and stored in the "MODELS" folder. The models are trained in batch mode and the process is described in the corresponding section.
  howdtrader use sliqte database as default, and also support mongodb and
mysql if you want to use it. If you want to use other database, you can
change the configuration in howtrader/vt_setting.json, here is the full
configuration key, you can just config the corresponding values.

to crawl the Binance exchange kline data for backtesting, you just need
to create a crawl_data.py file, just in the main.py directory. copy and
paste the following codes:
